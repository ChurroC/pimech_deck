Thanks for checking out the PiMech Deck!  This is a Rapberry Pi Zero based computer in the all in one, 
homebuilt style of a cyberdeck.  It features:

* Adjustable 7" LCD Screen
* Integrated USB hub with three external ports
* 36 key mechanical keyboard running QMK for full customization 
* 4500 mah battery and integrated charging for 4+ hours of run time
* Small sized and light weight
* Designed around a metal plate with segmented 3d printed parts which should fit on almost any printe

This repo has all of the files needed to cut the main structural plate and print up all the 3d parts.
I'm also including my Fusion 360 file if you want to remix/investigate or otherwise use it.  This is 
not a complete build guide or how-to as I did not really think about it while building and didn't capture
some specific details.  I do think the BOM, the few photos I took, and the STL/DXF files should let a 
anyone intrepid enoug reproduce this design, or even improve it!  

Reach out if you have any questions, I'm happy to help - rich@brickbots.com 

If you build on of these, or something related, I'd love to see it!
